> Next-generation end-to-end low code platform.

Application Engine is a workflow management system fully supporting low-code language Petriflow. Application Engine (NAE
for short)
is based on Spring framework with fully complaint Petriflow language interpreter. NAE runs inside the Java Virtual
Machine. It can be embedded into Java 11 project or used as a standalone process server. On top of the process server,
NAE provides additional components to make integration to your project/environment seamless.

## Components

Netgrif Application Engine (or NAE for short) consists of several key components:

* **Workflow engine**
    * **Process executions** - Process instance and task management
    * [**Actions and Events processing**](https://engine.netgrif.com/#/events/events) - Compiling and running action's
      code, handling events in processes
    * [**Roles management and permissions resolution**](https://engine.netgrif.com/#/roles/permissions) - Permissions and
      restrictions resolving for processes
    * [**Search and filters**](https://engine.netgrif.com/#/search/filter) - Indexing, querying and filter management.
* **Authentication and authorization** - User management and application-wide permissions
    * [**LDAP**](https://engine.netgrif.com/#/integration/ad_kerberos) - Integration to authentication solution via LDAP
      protocol.
    * **Organization structures** - Managing organization structure for application users
* **Business rules engine** - Rules execution across whole application based on [Drools](https://drools.org/)
* **Logging and auditing** - Logging to text file and Event/Audit log generation to the main database
* **Mail service** - Mail client for sending and receiving emails
* **Extension services**
    * [**PDF generator**](https://engine.netgrif.com/#/services/pdf_generator) - Generate PDF from process form / task
    * **QR code generator** - Generate QR code from process data

## Requirements

The Application engine has some requirements for runtime environment. The following table is summary of requirements to
run and use the engine:

| Name                                                   | Version | Description                                                     | Recommendation                                                         |
|--------------------------------------------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Java](https://openjdk.java.net/)                      | 11+     | Java Development Kit                                            | [OpenJDK 11](https://openjdk.java.net/install/)                        |
| [Redis](https://redis.io/)                             | 5+      | Key-value in-memory database used for user sessions and caching | [Redis 6.2.6](https://redis.io/download)                               |
| [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)                    | 4.4+    | Main document store database                                    | [MongoDB 4.4.11](https://docs.mongodb.com/v4.4/installation/)          |
| [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) | 7.17+   | Index database used for better application search               | [Elasticsearch 7.17.3](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases/elasticsearch-7-17-3) |

If you are planning on developing docker container based solution you can use our [docker-compose](docker-compose.yml)
configuration to run all necessary databases to develop with NAE.

<!-- If you are going to deploy your application on Kubernetes cluster please check out documentation
for [Kubernetes deployment](https://engine.netgrif.com/#/devops/kubernetes). -->

## Installation

### Running as standalone

You can start using the NAE by its self and then upload your processes via API. You run the NAE from JAR (Java Archive)
file or as docker container.

#### Running a JAR file

To run the engine from the jar file you can use a release package available from this repository. The latest release
package you can download from [here](https://github.com/netgrif/application-engine/releases/latest). Before you start
you must generate own RSA key pair for session tokens, you can
follow [this guide](https://engine.netgrif.com/#/views/public_view?id=backend).

To quickly start working with the engine just write the following commands to download, unzip, generate security keys
and start:

```shell
$ wget -O nae.zip https://github.com/netgrif/application-engine/releases/latest
$ unzip nae.zip
$ cd nae
$ cd src/main/resources/certificates && openssl genrsa -out keypair.pem 4096 && openssl rsa -in keypair.pem -pubout -out public.crt && openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform DER -nocrypt -in keypair.pem -out private.der && cd ../../../..
$ java -jar nae.jar
```

Only generate security keys:

```shell
$ cd src/main/resources/certificates && openssl genrsa -out keypair.pem 4096 && openssl rsa -in keypair.pem -pubout -out public.crt && openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform DER -nocrypt -in keypair.pem -out private.der && cd ../../../..
```

By default, the engine assumes that all databases are running locally. If you are running required database on server or
on different ports, you can pass these settings as arguments to NAE.

```shell
$ java -jar nae.jar --spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb://localhost:27017/nae --spring.data.elasticsearch.url=localhost --spring.session.redis.host=localhost
```

<!-- For complete list of all configurable application properties
see [article in documentation](https://engine.netgrif.com/properties). -->

#### Running as Docker container

You can also use docker to run the engine from the official image
on [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/netgrif/application-engine).

```shell
$ docker pull netgrif/application-engine
$ docker run -d -p 8080:8080 netgrif/application-engine
```

As the engine connects by default to locally ran databases for more precise configuration we recommend to use Docker
compose file or Kubernetes manifest to run whole stack all at once. <!-- You can read more about it
in [this guide](https://engine.netgrif.com/#/devops). -->

### Embedding

The Application Engine can be used inside your java application as a java library. The engine is written in Spring
framework, so you can seamlessly integrate it to your Spring Boot application. The engine can be linked as a Maven
dependency:

```XML

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.netgrif</groupId>
    <artifactId>application-engine</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

<!-- For more information please read instructions in [Get Started](https://engine.netgrif.com/#/get_started) -->

## Other projects

<!-- ### Frontend library

For complete Netgrif Application Engine experience check out
our [Angular library - Netgrif Components](https://github.com/netgrif/components)
for building frontend applications in Application Engine platform powered by Petriflow processes. -->

### Application Builder

For creating processes in Petriflow language try our free Application Builder
on [https://builder.netgrif.com](https://builder.netgrif.com). You can start from scratch or import existing process in
BPMN 2.0 and builder automatically converts it into Petriflow.

### NCLI (Coming soon)

If you need help with setting up project or looking for tool to automate your developer work with NAE based
applications, take a look on [NCLI (Netgrif Command Line Interface)](https://github.com/netgrif/ncli).
