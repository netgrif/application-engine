## Ways you can contribute

First, make sure you've read the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). TL;DR: be excellent to each other. Be calm, be
kind, help make engine a community where new faces feel welcome and old hands feel appreciated.

* Report a bug. If you've found something that doesn't work or doesn't make sense, let us know.
* Suggest a new feature.
* Suggest improvements to the platform.

### Reporting bugs

If you've found a bug, let us know about it.
* Search the [Issues](todo link) to check we're not already tracking it.
* If you can't find an open issue that describes your problem, [open a new one](todo link).
    * Include a **title and clear description**
    * Describe:
        * What you did (ideally with a code sample)
        * What you expected to happen
        * What actually happened, including any error messages or program output.
        * Include the version of the platform and environment that you used to run the engine.

### Fixing Bugs

If you've fixed an open bug - awesome!
* Open a new GitHub pull request with your patch. Pull requests should include:
    * The fix itself.
    * One or more example cases, that should FAIL on an unpatched implementation and PASS with your patch in place.
    * Updates to any associated documentation or examples.
    * Test that verifies the correctness of your implementation.

### Contributing Features

If you've got a great idea for the engine feature, start by checking
[issues](todo link) to check we're not already tracking it, or that your idea
hasn't already been rejected.

If not, start by [opening an issue](todo link) that describes your idea.
Do not be afraid of rejection, every excellent idea has to start somewhere. Give it a well described solution to the problem which your proposition is trying to solve.
